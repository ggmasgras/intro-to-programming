        <h2>HTML</h2>
        <p>- Hypertext Markup Language -- basis of almost every web page</p>
        <p>- HTML glues everything together; HTML documents are the "heart" of the web</p>

        <h2>Major Pieces of the Web</h2>

        <p>- you &amp; your computer + browser (IE, Chrome, Firefox, Safari, etc.)</p>
        <p>- The Internet</p>
        <p>- Servers</p>

        <p>Your computer browser <em>makes a request</em> over the internet to the servers using the <em>HTTP protocol</em>, and the servers respond back via the internet.</p>

        <div>Servers are like computers, just optimized for sitting in a closet, hosting files.</div>

        <span>HTTP is a simple protocol that the  browser uses to communicate with the servers.</span>

        <p>The internet uses HTTO to communicate with you, your browser and servers.</p>

        <p>HTML is made up of:</p>

        <p>- <b>text content</b> -- what you see</p>
        <p>- <b>markup</b> -- what is looks like</p>
        <p>- <b>references to other documents</b> -- e.g. images &amp; video</p>
        <p>- <b>links to other pages</b></p>


        <h2>HTML Markup</h2>

        <h3>HTML Attributes</h3>
    
        <p><b>Anchors</b> - are used for creating links. They include:</p>

        <p>- <b>href</b> - attribute name<br>
           - <b> link</b> (i.e. www.reddit.com )- the value
        </p>

        <b>Image tag</b> includes:

        <p>- img opening/closing tags<br>
           - source (src)<br>
           - alt (alternate) - text that displays when the image doesn't load -- REQUIRED
        </p>

        <p>Image tags are called "void" tags; they have no content and thus require no closing tag.</p>

        <p>Break is also a void tag, used for line breaks.</p>

        <p>Paragraph tag <em>is NOT</em> a void tag; it creates a box around the content so it needs a closing tag.</p>

        <p>The break tag is an inline tag; it is ending a line ("the line ends here").</p>

        <p>The paragraph p tag is a block; it creates an 'invisible' box around the text. This box can have height and width--which can be customized, while the break tag only ends the line.</p>

        <p>Other inline elements are <b>bold tag</b>, <em>emphasis tag</em>, and the image tag.</p>

        <p><b>Boxes &amp; Containers -- Span &amp; Div Elements</b></p>

        <span>Span is an inline element creating an inline container element.</span> 

        <div>Div is a block element creating a 'box' container element. These elements do not do anything other than contain their content. There is a way to attach styling elements to them to influence the way in which they are displaying.</div>
    
        <h3>HTML Document</h3>

        <p>Includes:<br>
            - <b>doctype</b><br>
            - <b>HTML tag</b> - encompasses all the content on the page<br>
            - <b>head tag</b>- includes info such as metadata, Java script, CSS, as well as the title tag with the title of the page<br>
            - <b>body tag</b> - includes the content of the document
        </p>

    </body>
